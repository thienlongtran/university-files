# Software Design & Organization I

This is a backup from the course's Gitlab repository. I took and practiced with Python starting many years ago, but this course was my first "official" one that I recveived credit for. The programs have instances of questionable variable names, a lack of commenting, and other beginner mistakes, but it's history!
