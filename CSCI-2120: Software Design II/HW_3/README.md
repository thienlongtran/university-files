# Serialization Bonus - Homework 3

Hello Dr. Summa!
My name is Thien Tran and I am a Sophomore Computer Science student here at The University of New Orleans. This is my submission for Homework 3 of Software Design & Development II. This programs implements a "save and load game" feature for a previously-provided adventure game.

# Files

There are two folders provided in this program:

AdventureGame_v1.0: The adventure game with a predefined save-file

Extra Extra Bonus: The additional bonus implementation that allows users to specify the names of their own saved-game files


## Using The Program

To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the program and run the game with "cat d1.txt - | java AdventureGame"
2. Do either of the following after running the program:

            A. Start a new game by following the prompt

            B. Load a previously saved game by following the prompt

3. Play the game by using the "WASD" keys to move around

## Saving a Game

To save a game, you need to be in a currently running game. During the game, type in "save" and follow the prompts.
