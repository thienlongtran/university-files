# Heap - Homework 4

This program calculates amount of time it takes to complete a heap using the insertion and build heap functions with three different types of lists: ordered lists, randomized lists, and reverse-ordered lists. Disney Princess objects with power levels are used in place of pure integers. The program is multithreaded to ensure that differences in runtime aren't due to spikes due to hardware.
