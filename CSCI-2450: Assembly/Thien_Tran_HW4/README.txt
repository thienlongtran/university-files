Hello Dr. Arifuzzaman! (Or whoever's grading this!)

My encryption-decryption program may look funky because I wrote the entire thing from scratch because
I didn't realize that a sample program was already provided, haha... But I provided a decryption program
that uses the same XOR logic as the encryption to show that the entire thing is working correctly even if
the encrypted text looks different from the sample program.

Hope you have a wholesome rest of the day!
