# Radix Sort - Bonus HW

Radix Sort is a sorting algorithm where numbers are grouped together by the order of each of its digits in a nth place. This is done one-by-one for each significant figure and it eventually creates an order at the end. Radix Sort usually only works with integers, but luckily strings can be represented as integers by their ASCII value. Using this idea, this program implements a Radix Sort algorithm that sorts strings by their alphabetical order.

# Testing the Program

To test the program, compile all of the java files and run JUnit using: **java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore RadixTester**
