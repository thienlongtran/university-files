# Algorithm Analysis - Homework 1

For this assignmented, I will analyze the efficiency of the energy-calculation algorithm provided. I should mention that I forgot about the "for simplicity assume that Math.sqrt costs us 6 ticks of the clock" until after the assignment was already due.... But I hope my analysis is still correct!

I also forgot to mention - even though both the main and bonus algorithms have an O(n^2) complexity, the bonus algorithm should still be used assuming that both algorithm provides the same result. This is because the average (Theta(n)) time complexity is better.
