# Shapes - Homework 1

Hello Friend!
My name is Thien Tran and I am a Sophomore Computer Science student here at The University of New Orleans. This is my submission for Homework 1 of Software Design & Development II. This program will allow you to create shapes using specific coordinates, similar to how you'd create shapes on graphing paper.

# Files

This program comes with four files: Point2D.java, Shape.java, ShapeTests.java, Triangle.java, and Rectangle.java
I also did the Circle bonus which resides in the "bonus2" folder.

# NOTICE: Shape Coordinates

For the Triangle class, the program assumes that there are two Point2D objects (coordinates) with equivalent Y-Values
For the Rectangle class, the program assumes that there are two sets of Point2D objects (coordinates) with equivalent Y-Values

## Using The Program

To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Edit the "ShapeTests" file with the text editor/IDE of your choice
2. Do either of the following:
A. Modify the Point2D objects listed under each "@Test" to fit the coordinates of your choice (Triangles and Rectangles assumes that the base/s have/has two Point2D objects/points that shares the same "Y" value).
B. Keep the values that are already provided.
3. Compile the files and run ShapeTests through JUnit!
