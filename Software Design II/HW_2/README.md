# Recursion - Homework 2

Hello Friend!
My name is Thien Tran and I am a Sophomore Computer Science student here at The University of New Orleans. This is my submission for Homework 2 of Software Design & Development II. This program will allow you to compare the alphabetical order of any string and any array of strings.

# Files

This program comes with two files:

CompareString.java - the actual implementation

CompareStringTests.java - the tester for the implementation

# NOTICE: Type of String

Although this program can work with strings without these conditions, this program assumes that the strings do not have any spaces and do not have any special characters such as @ and !

## Using The Program

To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Edit the "CompareStringTests" file with the text editor/IDE of your choice
2. Do either of the following:

            A. Modify the strings in the arrays of each @Test method

            B. Keep the values that are already provided.

3. Compile the files and run CompareStringTests through JUnit!
