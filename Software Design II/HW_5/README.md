# Linked List - Homework 5

This program creates an implementation of a doubly-linked list with the working single-linked list that was already provided. This data structure is compatible with any object that correctly overrides the "equals" method. This program will use a custom Dog object for testing purposes.

# Files

Dog.java - the object that will be housed inside the Linked List

DogLinkedListTester.java - the JUnit tester for the implementation

Iterator.java - the iterator of the Linked List

LinkedList.java - the actual implementation of the Linked List

ListRunner.java - a general purpose runner that was used for debugging


## Using The Program

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Compile all of the files through a terminal using: javac *.java

2. Run the tester through JUnit using: **java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore DogLinkedListTester**
