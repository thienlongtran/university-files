It appears that the files compiled with the -O3 flag runs significantly faster than the regular files.

The two files compiled with the -O3 flag seem to do the exact same thing as their regular counterparts.

I don't know exactly how this works, but it seems that the -O3 flag optimizes for a better execution time compared to a regular compilation.
